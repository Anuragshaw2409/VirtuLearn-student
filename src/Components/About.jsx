        If teachers were given more freedom, as would likely happen if a blended learning model were introduced as mentioned above, innovation would rocket, and an education system overhaul isn't exactly necessary to accomplish that. After all, there are (and will always be) plenty of options open to teachers to introduce more creativity and innovation to their lessons. Some of the options include Learning Management System (LMS), which allows teachers to create their own personalized, interactive courses from content provided by a range of publishers. Students can then access these courses on any device, while the app keeps a record of how they are progressing. If students are struggling. the course can quickly be altered. If students struggle with boredom, game-based learning can be introduced with LMS. Although granting teachers access to tablets and smartboards may help boost their comfort with education technology, many teachers simply have not thought about how they can best utilize technology in their curriculum. Indeed, the way a history teacher utilizes laptops in the classroom may be very different than the way a math teacher utilizes a smartboard. Both likely require plenty of time for trial, error, and experimentation to bring their lesson plans up to date. A major challenge in the adoption of new tools is not providing teachers with the guidance they need to make education technology work for them in their specific classroom. To overcome the challenge, it is necessary to have ERP solution for the teachers with adequate credit mechanism which can used for appraisals and performance-based incentives to the teachers. Experts
